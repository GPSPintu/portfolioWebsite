                <p>You interact with JavaScript code all the time — you just might not realize it. It powers dynamic behavior on websites (like this one) and plays an important role in many fields, like front- and back-end engineering, game and mobile development, virtual reality, and more.</p>

                <h2>Learn javaScript- in fun way!</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is used by almost every website on the internet, so I embarked on a quest to find the best active JavaScript blogs for programmers. Each of these sites demonstrates technical expertise, is relatively easy to comprehend, publishes content consistently, and has stood the test of time.

                    During this process, I used a consistent approach to analyze and compare common qualities (or deficiencies) in each blog. I looked at the depth of each blog’s technical content and the usefulness of that content. I read a few posts from start to finish to get a sense of the writing quality and comprehensibility. I looked at how consistently each web dev blog publishes new content, and I did some digging to learn how long each site has been around. Most of these blogs are similar in that they offer in-depth articles on other areas of web development, making them ideal blogs for programmers.</p>

                    <p>With two decades of improvement, JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages of all time. The journey started in 1995 when Brendan Eich created JavaScript in just 10 days. From there, it has seen multiple revisions, drafts, and growth in the form of frameworks, API’s, modules, etc. Today, we will go forward and list the top JavaScript blogs from the internet so that you can enjoy the lastest development in the field of JavaScript.

                        According to RedMonk programming language rankings and GitHut.info, JavaScript is leading the pack in the terms of repositories and the most discussed programming language on StackOverFlow. The numbers itself speaks about the future of JavaScript as it has grown beyond the initial capabilities of simple DOM manipulations.
                        
                        Learning JavaScript, on the other hand, can be a tricky proposition. New libraries, features, API’s or Style Guide, pop up almost every day. The speed of iteration is beyond imagination, and that is why reading leading JavaScript blogs are the best approach to keep up with new changes.</p>
